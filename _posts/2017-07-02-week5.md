This week, we had our 1st GSoC Evaluation! I had to fill a form as an assignment for this evaluation. By the end of this week, I had cleared my GSoC Evaluation! Thank you to my mentor [Aurelia](https://github.com/auremoser). She has been my support and guide during this GSoC period. We are all aware of our mentor's busy schedule, but she never missed a checkin or call from me! I hope to make her proud :)

I need to merge all the changes in the master branch. Next step involves integration of Dashboard. I had also added a minor feature to export the graph data into CSV file. This feature is useful for the admin to study the study group community.

# Roadmap
## Study Group Activity Visualizations

Visualizing the activities and online presence of Study Groups globally.

Mozilla's [Study Group Events Reporting Tool](https://mzl.la/sg-events) helps us log events manually and display them on a site. We also can crawl for events that are logged in individual study group repositorys with [this tool](https://github.com/auremoser/sg-events). We'd like to create a useful workflow between these tools and datasets, enabling us to create visualizations of the activities or events from all Study Groups globally. There are multiple steps to this process, with the overall goal of improving web visibility and accessibility for our Study Group community.

Want to jump in?
- [Good first bugs](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup-GSOC/labels/good%20first%20bug): This is a good place to start if you're new to the project. These issues are all mentored.
- [Design](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup-GSOC/labels/design): We need some help designing visualizations and deciding how they will display on the Mozilla Study Group Project page, or whether they might warrant a separate website.
- [Writing code](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup-GSOC/labels/development): Ready to write some JavaScript with us? These issues are waiting for you!
- [Discuss](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup-GSOC/labels/question): There are still some open ended questions for these visualization prototypes. Join in on the discussion.

## Short term - what we're working on now :tada:
- **Testing + QA'ing + Improving our Materials** (#4)
  - Ways to improve our existing Study Group Resources would be greatly appreciated, and often come from people who have walked through the process of [creating a study group](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup#for-new-organizers), and following our [orientation guide](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/). Submitting issues related to the user experience, typos, or missing aspects of our documentation are most welcome! Check the issues for each resource mentioned in our resource table in this [README](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup-GSOC#project-description).
- **Preparing data** (#5)
  - It would be great to work on valid JSON or GeoJSON about Study Group activity or event, it's often the easiest format to work with for visualizations in Javascript. Check what we mean by JSON in our [Study Group Events Crawler](https://github.com/auremoser/sg-events).
  - This is the goal for 'Google Summer of Code 2017' 
- **Designing Visualizations** (#3 #2 #6)
  - Creating visualizations of data about our Study Groups, prefereably interactives that we could update, automate and embed on our [Study Group Project Page](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups).
  - This is the goal for 'Google Summer of Code 2017' 
- **UI Enhancement**
  - Create a user friendly UI and add features on [Study Group Event](https://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroupEvents) Page. Features include filtering of events, visualization, populate data etc.
## Medium term - what we're working on next! :cake:
- **Localisation** (#8)
  - Right now, the [Study Group Repo](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup) documentation is in English, with some (awesome but sporadic) translations in [Indonesian](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lesson-template-id.md), [Bengali](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/bn.yml) and [Portugeuse](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/README-pt.md) submitted by our community members, we'd love to solicit more languages or improvements on these translations if noted/necessary.
  - This is the goal for 'Google Summer of Code 2017' 
## Longer term items  - working on this soon! :fast_forward:
- **Define a Reporting Process** (#7)
  - Right now, stats about Study Groups globally are scattered between multiple repositories (the [Study Group Website](http://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroup/), the [Study Group Lessons Repo](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupLessons), the [Orientation Gitbook](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/), just to name a few). We would create a unified set of scripts that pulls contributor data from these repos and compiles it into a dataset or short report, and would greatly help us showcase what our Study Groups are doing, and support them locally.
  - This is the goal for 'Google Summer of Code 2017' 

These items are not essiential for an MVP, but are a part of our longer term plans. Feel free to jump in on these if you're interested!
